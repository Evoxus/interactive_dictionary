# interactive_dictionary
This simple dictionary script asks the user for input on the command line, checks for a similar word in the data.json file and if found
returns either a close match or the definition for the word. The close match will check if this was the word the user meant.
If no close match is found it tells the user it isn't sure that is a real word and asks for a word again.
